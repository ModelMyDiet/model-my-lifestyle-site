One of our developers and founders, Eric, is best known for losing countless hours of sleep to give the Model My Diet Community the best experience with their models.

Eric decided recently to join his users in their weight loss journey by making a lifestyle change of his own. After experimenting with an array of ingredients  he has come up with his favorite fruit smoothie concoctions to share with the community!
