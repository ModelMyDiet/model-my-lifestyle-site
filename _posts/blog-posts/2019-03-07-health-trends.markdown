##### TRY – The Mind Diet

Also known as the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, the MIND diet combines two popular diets: The Mediterranean Diet and the DASH Diet. This diet is not only designed to lose weight and stay fit, but also to improve brain health and prevent dementia. Therefore, this regimen focuses on healthy foods such as fruit, leafy vegetables, olive oil, fish, beans, and wine that are known to improve cognitive ability.

##### TRY – Water-based HIIT

High-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts have been all the rage in the past couple of years. HIIT burns tons of calories by alternating between quick high-intensity workouts with short resting periods. It is said to highly increase your metabolic rate and help you burn calories faster. However, this year, water is all the rage and HIIT is coming off-shore and diving into the deep end. Many gyms are offering HIIT circuit class trainings in pools to offer more of a workout. Water provides added resistance to high-intensity cardio and maximizes the benefits of HIIT.

##### TRY – Cruise Control Diet

The Cruise Control Diet is specifically designed for yo-yo dieters, or people that tend to fall in and out of diets. Since it can be hard to follow a strict diet, the Cruise Control Diet has four simple rules as follows: don’t count calories, eat natural foods, avoid processed foods, and enjoy guilty pleasures every now and then. These guidelines make the diet easy to follow and has become one of the highest rated diet programs of 2017. It is not just a diet, but a way towards a healthy lifestyle.

##### AVOID – Souping

Juicing has become a huge movement in recent years. However, now the trend has shifted towards souping. While souping can be a better choice than juicing, it eliminates key nutrients that are needed to stay healthy. According to dieticians, people on the souping diet miss out on a lot of protein and fiber. It is also difficult to stick to the diet plan as it can be rather boring and bland.

##### AVOID – Things that Shake

Many people are attracted to equipment that make exercise easier. However, it’s time to face the truth –– exercise isn’t easy! You can’t buy a machine that will simply shake the weight off of your body. The vibrating lap belts and Shake Weights that you see advertised on your television screen are unfortunately a gimmick to make money. Users of these devices report that they did not increase their muscular strength and did not lose weight. You are better off saving your money and investing in a gym. Remember –– before jumping on the band wagon it is important that you do your research to avoid wasting time and money on false fitness fads!
