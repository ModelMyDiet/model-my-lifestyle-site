### Cheat with Dignity on Your Diet: Dining at Amy’s Drive-Thru

![image](/img/blog-img/amy-1.jpg)

When you are trying to create a healthier lifestyle for yourself, fast foods like McDonalds and Chipotle pose a threat to your transition into weight loss. Unhealthy decision-making is made when we are at our hungriest and unfortunately, these are reliable to provide the wrong kind of sustenance.

Anyone who has a cheat day knows how easy it is to relapse into the same cycle of unhealthy eating. Now there is hope for our cheat days, because a new type of fast food chain has opened up and it offers organic ingredients.

Amy’s Drive Thru is a new kind of fast-food chain. A vegetarian joint that claims to use no GMOs and offer vegan options for our favorite foods like Mac ‘n’ Cheese or a regular cheese burger!
