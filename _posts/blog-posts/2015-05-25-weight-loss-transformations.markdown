### The Best Before and After Weight Loss Transformations

So many amazing transformations this summer is inspiring everyone to reach their weight loss goals. We took some of the best transformations from the web and reimagined these weight loss challengers  with their own virtual models. Each model is wearing a bathing suit from the Model My Diet collection, some available for your own model!

### The Little Black Number

Starting with the most popular and recent before and after by Toronto-based photographer Blake Morrow.

His photos series of his friend Beth posing with her new body after her bypass surgery takes an animated look at her transformation.

For her model, we continued with the beach theme and stayed true to her new look with this black one piece bathing suit.

Not only is her model’s new body fit, but beautiful in that one piece; showing off every curve for summer.



### The Two Piece Wonder

We found this before and after on Trimmed and Toned and decided to dress her virtual model in a two piece halter bikini.

This young girl got fit for summer and it only felt right to give her a model that reflected that. Now she and her model can enjoy their curves in the sun.


### The Bold and Beautiful

This weight loss challenger reached her goal and was able to show off that black and white striped two piece bikini.

Lucky for us, we had a one piece striped halter very similar to the ensemble above. Her model’s amazing transformation is just a reflection of the hard work and dedication that goes into a weight loss goal.

### Rainbow Ambition

This rainbow multicoloured two piece bikini was inspired by this young girl who went beyond her weight loss goal. Not is she and her model toned, but enjoying their new bodies. How did they do it?
