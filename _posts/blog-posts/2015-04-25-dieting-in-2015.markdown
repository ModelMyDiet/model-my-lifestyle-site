### Paleo Diet
the Paleo diet was made popular in 2014, people are still curious as to what it is. Do you eat like a cavemen? Are you only limited to raw food? The Paleo diet is based on the concept of eating like a nomad, incorporating more fruits, nuts, lean meats and veggies as opposed to processed packaged meals.

Since this diet focuses on staying away from processed foods, it encourages dieters to eliminate foods such as refined sugar, bread, pasta, dairy products, and anything our nomadic ancestors did not have access to.

A lot of the foods prohibited make up most people’s diets and being on a Paleo diet can be discouraging and expensive if you do not know what to cook.

Luckily, the experts and advocates of the Paleo diet have come up with many cookbooks to guide new challengers on their journey to weight loss. You can find simple recipes that are easy to make in under 20 minutes!

The purpose of this diet is to combat high blood pressure and hypertension, while building a healthy cholesterol.

There must be something in the water, because the next diet on this list has everyone going back to their Mediterranean roots. The Mediterranean diet looks at the diet of countries living along the mediterranean border like Greece, Italy, Spain, and south of France. What all these countries have in common is that they incorporate more fish, beans, and olive oil into their diet, with the occasional glass of wine.

What separates this diet from the rest?

This diet does not focus on calorie intake, it instead encourages users to eat more fish-based dishes and less red meat.
Drinking red wine in moderation is a bonus, since wine has been proven to lower blood pressure and the risk of heart disease.

The Mayo Clinic diet provides a systematic way to lose weight. Their unique pyramid emphasizes the importance of having fruits and veggies in your diet.
This encourages users to actually alternate their favourite sweets with fruitier options. The Mayo Clinic diet also provides a step-by-step guide to help users stay on track with their diet. The purpose of this diet is to replace your bad eating habits with good ones.

What separates this diet from the rest?

The Mayo diet claims that in the first two weeks, you will shed 6-10 pounds with their two part diet. This first part called “Lose It” focuses on evaluating your eating and exercise behaviours without the use of counting calories.

This is the disciplinary stage of your diet; breaking old habits. You can indulge in fruits and vegetables, because this is the stage where you start to build a healthy diet.
The second stage, referred to as “Live It”, is the stage where you learn to make a routine of your new healthy habits. In this stage, you start to measure your calorie intake determining the amount of calories you will eat on a daily basis. You want to focus on portion size and having healthy eating patterns, do that and you will be writing a success story in no time!
