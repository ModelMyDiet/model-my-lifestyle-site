# Why High-Intensity Interval Training Works

##### The Benefits of HIIT

High-Intensity Interval Training (known as HIIT) is a workout technique that alternates between bursts of high-intensity exercise and short periods of recovery or less extreme activity. This type of workout is known to reap the muscle-strengthening benefits while burning off fat, all within a shorter timeframe than traditional exercise routines. A session of high-intensity interval training will push you to reach a high heart rate, as you complete as many reps as you possibly can. For instance, one would sprint for 10 to 20 seconds followed by a short period of walking before repeating intense activity again. This routine will ultimately force your body use more oxygen which causes your metabolism to work at a higher level than normal — allowing you to burn more calories during your workout and even hours later!   

##### More Time Efficient

Unlike continuous training that can take up to an hour at the gym, HIIT is great for any busy schedule, as workouts can be done under less than half the amount of time without the fancy equipment. Your options are quite endless with what you can incorporate into your personal HIIT sessions. Anything from running to cycling or even traditional push-ups and jumping lunges, this workout technique can be done almost anywhere at anytime, no matter the constraints!

##### Improves Your Cardiovascular Health

Since HIIT involves exertion that your body isn’t necessarily used to, you will most likely find your heart trying to jump out of your chest. However, studies have shown that after incorporating a few of these highly intensive, yet brief workouts to your routine, an improvement to your cardiovascular health can be seen in as little as two weeks. These bursts of rigorous activity have also demonstrated enhancements in how blood vessels transport blood through the body, while heightening brain activity. Overall, HIIT is not only beneficial to those who want to lose weight, but also to people who are looking to strengthen their cardiovascular fitness and better their circulatory system, which will ultimately help them to succeed in lasting longer during future workouts.

##### Boosts Endurance

Along with providing enhancements to your overall health, it’s no shock that high-intensity workouts will boost your endurance as well. This workout regimen will allow you to tolerate higher levels of intensity for a longer period of time which makes HIIT easier to maintain than continuous, low to moderate-intensity exercise. Another huge positive to this type of training is the fact that it’s easier on body joints, which can become problematic for long distance runners in particular.

##### Easier To Maintain

Unlike traditional low to moderate-training that many people incorporate into their routine, high-intensity interval training will keep you on your toes. Not only are you not tied to fancy gym equipment, but your options remain unlimited in terms of what you can do for intensive activities and where you do them! In fact, many of those who have tried HIIT, end up sticking with it for a much longer time. This is no shock as HIIT leaves you with less time to be bored since you are constantly diversifying your workout routine, all while building up endurance!
