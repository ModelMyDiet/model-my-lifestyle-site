The Journal of American Medicine released a study this week presenting evidence that obesity has hit an all time high in the U.S. According to the study, there are more obese americans than there are overweight ones.

The study, conducted by the Washington University School of Medicine, was based on data regarding race, ethnicity, age, gender, and a person’s BMI index. The study used data dating from 2007 to 2012 from a previous report conducted by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The study examined 15,000 men and women over the age of 25.

The results showed that an estimated 36 million men were overweight, while 29 million women were also found overweight. What’s even more shocking is that there are more obese women than there are men; 36 million versus 32!

Obesity is a growing problem in America that can only be stopped with a balanced diet and exercise routine. However, being ignorant of the dangers of obesity can put your health at risk in the longterm. Obesity can lead to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers like thyroid and pancreatic.
