### OITNB’s Danielle Brooks’s Inspiring Instagram Account for Curvy Women Everywhere

Danielle Brooks’s made a surprising omission on her Instagram account the other day; it was the first time she went to the gym with just a sports bra. Anyone who is struggling through weight loss can understand how big of a non-scale victory that is for all women out there. There is something about being able to feel comfortable in your own skin in front of others that gives you the confidence you need to continue reaching your weight loss goals.

“I’ve always wanted to do this but have felt shameful and have told myself ‘until my body is perfect, I’m forbidden’. Today my inner being told me to turn up the notch on my self-love. I should not be ashamed of my body. I’m not a walking imperfection! I’m a Goddess. Secondly, I’m a confident woman! That doesn’t stop once I take off my spanx. Lol [.] Sometimes it’s a struggle. Sometimes I don’t like what I see, but I have the power to change the way in which I relate to my body both physically and mentally. Today I woke up feeling beautiful and motivated to love myself and take care of the ONE body that I’ve been given.” -Danielle Brooks

For anyone who is not familiar with Danielle Brooks, she is one of the stars in the prison comedy on Netflix, Orange is the New Black. She has always battled with her weight growing up and was not really aware of her size until a churchgoer pointed it out one day.

Now she dedicates her time to getting in shape and living a more healthy and active lifestyle, which you can see in a timeline of her photos from when she started OITHNB to where she is now. Not only does her body look great, but she gives a lot of curvy women ideas for dressing their new body.
