Women’s Health recently featured a story on one woman who was able to lose a whopping 175 pounds in spite of struggling with obesity her whole life. Jane Downward grew up compensating for her weight with her humour, but after hitting a staggering 373 pounds, she knew she needed to get on the right track to change. After realizing that she had been consuming 3000 calories daily, she did everything it took to lose the weight from joining to Spark People to betting on her own weight loss goals.

### Why was she so motivated?

“As I began to realize that I was going to be a mom soon, I started to notice parents who sat on the sidelines while their kids played at the park. I knew that if I didn’t lose weight, I would be like those moms and dads, not because I was distracted by my phone but because I wouldn’t be able to physically keep up with my kid. I didn’t want to miss a second of being a parent.”
