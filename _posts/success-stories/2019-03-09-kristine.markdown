Kristine, a member since 2003 shares her journey on the program.
</p>
<h3 class="green">
What happened in 2003 that made you become a member?
</h3>
<p>
In 2003 I was in Grade 10 in high school and I was always the biggest of my whole family, the biggest of my friends and [at that age] it really matters what you are wearing, and everyone was sharing clothes and that was never something I was able to do.
<br><br>
I was shopping for a sweet 16 birthday party at a store that I normally went to didn't have anything that fit me. The biggest size wouldn't do up and I decided that Weight Watchers was something I needed to do, and I literally went the next day.

What was the first day like?
</h3>
<p>
I walked in to the meeting and it was not at all what I thought it would be. It was so much better. I don't know what I was expecting. I thought they were going to weigh and measure me in front of everybody and it was going to be a whole scene and it wasn't. It was a really warm, welcoming environment The leader came right up to me. and it was just a group of normal people. I just sat in the back quietly. No one pressured me to say anything or do anything it was at my own pace which I really appreciated. Now, I literally don't stop speaking. I sit in the front, my hand is always up. and it's very different now than it was before.

How do you work the program at your own pace?
</h3>
<p>
At first I was able to sit at the back, no one asked me any questions, no one made me talk, so I was really just able to take it slowly and just sit, and listen, absorb it and not have to do anything that was outside of my comfort zone.
</p>
<h3 class="green">
What have you learned in regards to food and nutrition?
</h3>
<p>
I always assumed that Weight Watchers was going to be like a diet, so that I would have to give up everything I ever ate I was going to have to eat lettuce and celery and grilled chicken. I didn't know. really anything about nutrition. I was corning from eating fast food a lot, and a lot of takeout I learned a lot about healthy foods. I really started to learn more about the benefits of eating healthy foods, with higher protein and. less processed foods. With whole healthy foods, you feel a lot better. And when you go back to eating fast foods you - they don't taste the same, so I really learned that mentally and physically it's a lot better for you.
